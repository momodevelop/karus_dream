# What is this?
"Karu's Dream" is a simple game prototype where you play as Karu trapped in a nightmare, a nightmare where he can only move left, move right and jump; he cannot stop. 

Monsters will appear on the sides of the screen to eat him. Touching them would prove to be fatal.

Equipped with only a sword, try to defeat as many monsters as possible.

(I'll probably do High Score one day...)
